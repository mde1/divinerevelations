# Overview of the Project
The directory 'Original Typewritten Messages in Spanish' contains copies of the original typewritten messages shared from mid-2020 to 2025. It's only a small subset of more than 2,000 which exist. Pages with a number in upper right corner show the week number for the corresponding month in which the messages were received. Pages without the number are older messages shared that accompany the newest teachings. They may share similar themes. 

Enseñanzas.csv contains the original transcribed Spanish and the Google Translate English. I have another copy done with DeepL, but I encountered numerous errors with their API. 

Approximately 100 duplicate messages were removed. The pages were machine-read using ChatGPT, but it was not until closer inspection that a noticed a substantial number of mistakes. Most of the remaining issues won't alter the overall meaning of the message, but even minor errors should not be propagated into other languages. 

### Note for Contributors
Those who wish to contribute proofreading/transcription, please submit a pull request with:
1. the original text,
2. the corrected text,
3. and the filename/speaker of the message

Those who wish to contribute translation edits or footnotes, please submit a pull request with:
1. current text in Spanish and English
2. proposed translation
3. short justification for edit

## Tercer Testamento
The file 'Tercer Testamento.xlsx' contains the teachings and text parsed from:
tercertestamento.net
three-revelations.net
tres-revelaciones.net 

The 366 teachings from tercertestamento.net were translated using Google Translate. Three-Revelations.net already had the text available in English, I assume that it was auto-translated by Google. 

The Compendium of the Book of True Life is included in both Spanish and English. It's the best compilation I've read to date.

The prophecies compilation was downloaded from https://www.librodelavidaverdadera.mx/ and translated to English using Google Translate. 

Jakob Lorber's work is also worth analyzing if you're new to the Third Testament (Book of True Life).
